                I'm a problem solver, and I have a long history of excelling in computer science outside of normal circumstances. 
                I've programmed in a wide variety of languages from Fortran, Lisp, and C to Lua, JavaScript, and Python, most of them are self-taught.

                In middle school, I was playing a Minecraft modpack, and one of the mods added a computer to the game. 
                I assumed that it would be a simple little GUI that did various things for the game, 
                but instead it gave me a pseudo bash terminal with the ability to write Lua scripts to interact with the game world. 
                I immediately loved it and spent more time teaching myself Lua than actually playing the game. 
                Eventually, some of my other friends decided to try out writing scripts and I was able to "hack" through whatever scripts they could come up with.

                I continued to use Lua all throughout middle and high school. 
                I took part in the TSA game dev competition, and I decided to use Love2D, which was basically just a re-mapping of OpenGL into Lua. 
                Looking back on it I definitely would have had a much easier time using a different game engine, 
                rather than programming basically everything from scratch and somehow turning Lua into an object-oriented language. 
                Despite the troubles I had though, I placed second in the state.

                In high school, I took the AP computer science test even though I did not take the class. 
                In my spare time after school, I would come home and study from the AP computer science test prep book. 
                I got a 5. I was the only student in my high school who got a 5. 
                At this point in time, I had never taken a Computer Science or programming class.

                In my freshman year of college, I decided that I wanted to try my hand at writing a simple messaging program in python. 
                I didn't know much about networking and I was googling a lot as I went, which led to Google offering me the foobar challenge. 
                I managed to get all the way to the problem right before I would have been offered an interview with Google. 
                The last question was on Markov chains, and I got 9 out of the 10 test cases before I ran out of time. 
                I was still able to program a solution for 90% of the test cases despite not even taking linear algebra. 
                At this point in time, I still had not taken a computer science class; I was completely self-taught.

                When I started my internship at the Air Force, the other interns and I were told to automate manual test suites. 
                I wrote a JavaScript framework to trivialize a lot of the work that I had been doing. 
                I was able to churn through the test suites that were handed to me faster than any other intern. 
                When I left I was told that I was one of only 2 people out of 12 that they would like to see back.

                When I started working for Manhattan Associates, I set myself apart by writing scripts to automate a lot of the slow or tedious work that I was doing.
                I've written scripts that have saved the company hundreds of thousands of dollars by anticipating problems that haven't happened yet and already having a solution for it.
